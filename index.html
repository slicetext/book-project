		<h1>Interview with Mark Watney</h1>
		<p>
			Me: Hello, Mark. How are you?
			<br>
			Mark: Good, how are you?
			<br>
			Me: I'm good. What did it feel like when you were first left behind on Mars?
			<br>
			Mark: It was scary. I thought I might never come home again.
			<br>
			Me: How about when you established contact with Nasa? How did the feel?
			<br>
			Mark: That was an exciting milestone. It was important to my survival. Though they could be a little annoying.
			<br>
			Me: Was there a moment of panic when the MAV rocket lifted off?
			<br>
			Mark: There was. Since Nasa had me remove so much stuff from the rocket before launching it, I was worried it would fall apart with me in it!
			<br>
			Me: Finally, would you ever go back to Mars?
			<br>
			Mark: I don't know. I think I have spent more time on Mars than a guy could ever want!

		<h1>Theme</h1>
		<p>I think the theme of this book is to never give up. Mark doesn't give up even when the Hab ruptures, when his communication with Nasa is severed, or when his plants all die.</p>
